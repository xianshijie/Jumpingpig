# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is crucial to MaZhiXiogn. Therefore, I have a privacy policy that explains how I collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please read our privacy policy carefully and let us know if you have any questions.

Collection and use of personal information

Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact someone.

When you use products from MaZhiXiogn, you may be asked to provide your personal information. MaZhiXiogn and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. MaZhiXiogn and its affiliates may also combine this information with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content and advertising.

Below are some examples of the types of personal information that MaZhiXiogn may collect and how we use it.

What kind of personal information we collect

How do we use your personal information?

We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver and improve our products, services, content and advertising.

We may use your personal information from time to time to send important notices, such as news about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions and policies. Since this information is critical to your interaction with MaZhiXiogn, you cannot give up receiving such communication.

We also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve MaZhiXiogn's products, services, and communications with customers.

If you participate in a sweepstakes, contest or similar promotion, we will use the information you provide to manage such events.

Collect and use non-personal information

We also collect non-personal informationâ€”that is, data that is not directly associated with any particular individual. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. Below are some examples of non-personal information that we may collect and how we use it.

We collect information such as age, IP address, occupation, language, zip code, area code, device unique identifier, location, child nickname, child avatar, etc., so that we can better understand customer behavior, improve our products, services and Advertising.

We also collect information about our activities with our customers on our products and websites, as well as information obtained from our other products and services. We aggregate this information to help us provide our customers with more useful information and to understand which parts of our website, products and services are most interesting to customers. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, aggregated data is considered non-personal information.

If we combine non-personal information with personal information, such information will be treated as personal information while the merger is maintained.

Cookies and other technologies

MaZhiXiogn's websites, online services, interactive applications, email messages and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our site are being viewed, and improve and measure the effectiveness of ads and web searches. We treat information collected through cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, if local laws treat IP addresses or similar identifying marks as personal information, we also treat these identifying marks as personal information. Similarly, in the case of this Privacy Policy, where non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information.

Like most websites, we automatically collect certain information and store it in a log file. This type of information includes IP address, browser type and language, Internet Service Provider (ISP), indicator page and exit page, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information to understand and analyze trends, manage our website, understand user behavior on our website, and collect demographic information about our entire user base. MaZhiXiogn can use this information for our marketing and advertising services.

Protection of personal information

MaZhiXiogn takes a variety of precautions, including administrative, technical and practical measures, to protect your personal information from loss, misappropriation and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.
